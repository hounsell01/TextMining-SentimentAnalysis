# TextMining-SentimentAnalysis
Some work on the side to explore approaches to text mining and sentiment analysis. 

Working through some ideas on text mining. <br>
Looking at sentiment analysis of TripAdvisor reviews fior the Malt Cross pub/restaurant in Nottingham. <br>
Files:
- Word Cloud showing positive/negative sentiments: "mc trip advisor sentiment.jpeg" (also there's a pdf version)
- "maltcross1.csv": original screen-scraped data file of reviews. Gives mor messy result
- "mcp1.csv", "mcn1.csv": hand-edited files showing positive and negative words respecively for cleaner word cloud
- "mc sentiment word cloud.R": r-code file
