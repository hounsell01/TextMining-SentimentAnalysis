Great music
Dec 2024 • couples
Dropped in on 14/12 after shopping for a drink. I’ve always like the ambience of this place but today the DJs were excellent. Think they might be local students. Great chilled / dance vibes. If this was a regular night we’d visit more often.

"Good food, good drinks and great staff"
Dec 2024 • friends
"The food, service and drinks choice was brilliant with excellent staff who were helpful but not obtrusive."
"The venue has a great atmosphere, historic but not a pristine museum."
Seating is comfortable with lots of cosy places to sit and space between customers.
Give it a try you'll be very pleasantly suprised!

Best Office Christmas lunch ever!
Dec 2024 • business
"We came here for our office Christmas lunch. we booked a few months ago and did pre-orders. The selection was great, and was so nice to see a few options for vegetarians and a few more unusual choices for those who aren't fussed about roast turkey."
"The food was delicious, the staff were great and the interior is beautiful."
Will definitely come back soon!

Excruciatingly loud music!
Nov 2024 • family
Excruciatingly loud music to the extent that it was impossible to hold a conversation with the person next to you unless you cupped your hands and shouted in their ear. They ignored repeated requests to turn it down.

Surprised at the price of wine
Aug 2024 • couples
"Haven’t been to the Malt Cross for a while, but have some great nights there over the years. Popped in for a beer and a glass of wine for the wife, I know I should have asked or looked at the price of a large glass of Sauvignon Blanc but had a shock at the price of £12.90!"
"No problem with the beer prices as they were on a par with town prices, but the wine was on the par of restaurant prices"

Always good to be there
Jan 2024 • couples
Been here couple of times so it’s time to leave my review. Very nice and cosy place to have drinks or enjoy food. I love to sit top floor and enjoy view of hall down there where people enjoying. Cool staff and good service. This time they had security at door which was good. They’re serving mix drinks in keg and cask. Good to be here.

Please adjust the lighting
Feb 2023 • friends
"Good venue but lighting isn't as good as it used to be. Used to have the peripheral lighting bright and the central overhead lighting dimmer. This created a cosy atmosphere. Lately, the lighting has been bright and flat as if it's always chucking out time which doesn't help you relax."
The other problem is that there is rarely a stout or porter cask beer on tap.

Too busy to get into
Sep 2021 • friends
"Tucked away down St James Street is The Malt Cross Pub , a pub I always look forward to visiting on any trip to Nottingham I take, a beautiful interior, wonderful decor and furnishings, ornate features and plenty of seating options spread throughout the pub ,its a classic Nottingham pub,unfortunately on our visit it was to busy to get into ,totally disappointed really as the real ales served in here are excellent, on my next trip and this vibrant city I am most certainly going to drop by here and make sure I get in."
Most definitely well worth checking out if you're in the area.

Handsomeness Quiz Master in all the land
Sep 2020 • friends
"I’ve had the pleasure of doing the quiz at the Malt cross for several years now and I must so it’s getting harder and harder to finish the quiz. That’s not because of the challenge but because the quiz master is so sexy I can barely hold my pen yet along write straight! Such a great quiz but if the quiz master could tone down the sexy appeal by about 10% that would be ideal, don’t tone it down too much a boys got to eat! :)"

"Beer selection excellent in fact better than excellent, almost sublime."

"The staff working hard yet still chatty and friendly, and considering it was Friday night and it’s opposite one of the worst Wetherspoons I’ve ever seen their customer base is spot on."

"However it’s not the cheapest, couple of drinks served without ice, one drink served in a dirty glass...."

Overall though I liked it

Gin Tasting was brilliant!
Feb 2020 • none
"13 of us went to a gin tasting here, with Hannah and Terry, and it was brilliant! Hannah walked us through the history of gin and Genever, and she knew everything. She was so good to listen to and learn from, and really rolled with the punches as the gin kept flowing. Hannah is a born performer, and really entertained us, and Teri was so helpful, and kept us topped up all throughout while Hannah handed around artefacts and pictures to aide her storytelling. I would 100% recommend this - it is a great ice breaker, and the fact that we walked through some small art rooms to get to the underground room was fascinating! They even had an accessible lift for my elderly grandfather. Thanks so much Hannah and Teri!!"

Sunday dinner that wasn't boring
Jan 2020 • family
"I think the most boring meal ever is a Sunday roast, so it's not said lightly when I recommend a place that only does this type of meal on a Sunday dinner time. The veggie mushroom wellington option was very tasty. 5 types of veg plus roasted potatoes all served on a wooden board complement the Wellington slice, mash & oversized Yorkshire pud, also includes side dish of cauliflower cheese. All for £9.95. The Malt Cross is not your shiny corporate looking place to eat, it's an 1800's music hall with a wonderful glass roof. Well worth seeking out, on a Nottm side street."

A lovely relaxed vibe
Jan 2020 • family
"My daughter and I were on a weekend trip to Nottingham, we googled places to eat near our hotel and really liked the look of this place. Unfortunately we were to be disappointed as upon arrival on the Saturday evening there was a note on the door to say they were not serving food. Anyway we went elsewhere to eat. And decided to return later in the evening for a drink and we were glad we did. A lovely welcoming atmosphere in a beautiful old building. Very reasonable prices. There was a DJ playing and we enjoyed listening and soaking up the atmosphere. We did ask wether there would be food available on the next day as their Sunday lunches are supposed to be very good but we were out of luck again. Having said this would definitely return and hopefully be able to try their food next time."

Milk and Carols (all ages carol singing)
Dec 2019 • family
"We visit the Malt Cross every few months as we like the atmosphere, food and it's ethos (they provide help to local homeless people)."
When we heard about their Christmas grotto and all ages carol singing (Milk and Carols) we were really excited. It definitely did not disappoint. The grotto was beautifully decorated and Fr. Christmas was brilliant with my son. He sat on the floor and Fr. Christmas sat next to him.
The carols were lovely and the people leading the singing were fun and engaging. Song sheets were provided and they even said Merry Christmas in Makaton. It was a brilliant morning and we plan to come again next year.

Excellent festive gin tasting!
Dec 2019 • none
"We'd already enjoyed a heritage gin tasting session down in the caves so were keen to sign up for the festive 'Gin-Jingles' session. As the caves are temporarily out of action, this session took place in the basement craft room, which had been transformed into a wonderfully atmospheric recreation of a Victorian Christmas living room."

Our hosts Milly and Hannah (dressed in period costume and in character) introduced us into the spirit of Christmas by providing sips of several unusual craft gins (which surprisingly I found much better to taste without the provided tonic water). They also gave us lots of interesting information about gin and also the Victorians' Christmas traditions. Festive bell ringing also took place with some audience participation! Finally we all designed and produced our own Christmas gin blend to take away using a wide variety of aromatic flavourings. A really enjoyable festive evening and we left feeling warm and merry!

Great Sunday roast

The food was lovely, one of the best Sunday roasts I've had. The staff were nice and friendly and the place has a good atmosphere. It got very busy while we were there so obviously very popular."

Great Find
Oct 2019 • couples
Came across this place by accident as it's down a narrrow street and easy to miss.

It's an old music hall that has been restored wonderfully and as a result it oozes charachter. There is a balcony surrounding the ground floor where acts perform to the auduence below. The whole place is run as a charity and does tours around the underground caves!

Plenty of craft ales and gins on offer at reasonable prices. It all adds up to a great convivial atmosphere. We didn't eat but the food looked very good.

Heritage Gin Tasting Evening
Oct 2019 • friends
"A great evening, great setting in the basement of the old music hall. Hannah was excellent as our gin guide. Five gins spanning the history of gin. From monks wanting to preserve things to Netherlands to Gin Palaces to Post Prohibition America. A great story teller and singer and so much information delivered in a easy manner. Well worth booking and seeing some great events coming up. Drinking gin feels better when you know the charity you are helping is supporting Street Pastors."

"Good food, but more importantly a GREAT tour - a MUST visit"
Sep 2019 • none
"This is a must visit to the remanning oldest music hall outside London. It was opened in 1877 and hosted numerous celebrity acts. The tour lasts over an hour and is given in great detail and with great enthusiasm. There is even some rendition of favourite numbers which were performed. The interior is restored to its former glory and there is an atmosphere specific to buildings of they type. I loved the iconic high arched glazed roof. Outside we were enlightened about the street, which dates back to Norman times and the St James Church."

Gin Tasting Night
Sep 2019 • none
"A friend and I went to a gin tasting evening as we'd heard nothing but good things, I've been on a few similar nights before, but have to say this is by far one of the best yet, it was thoroughly interesting learning the history of gin, the music hall and even getting a cheeky song or two."

"Milly and her team was super friendly and knowledgeable on the subject of gin and overall Nottingham history, we tasted gins from every ""era"" learning how it evolved."

We managed to try 5 gins (With lots of fruit and tonic) and a final glass of our favourite gin at the end to take back to the bar.

"Would recommend to anyone, the group was a great size I'm already looking up the beer tasting and heritage tour!"

Thanks very much :D

Nice place food great noise really bad
Apr 2019 • friends
I went to the malt cross on Sunday afternoon with 16 friends.
Access:
The access is through a side street and this is very dark so beware if your sight impaired. Wheelchair access would be a problem as the tables are too close together so once your in it would be difficult to navigate around them. There is a lift but it’s a small one and there is a door before you get to it. Staff were very helpful if you ask them
Food
The Food was really well done and well brought out but it did take a while to get it. I had the chicken and it tasted really nice one. The place was very busy so I expected a wait. There’s not a lot on the menu but what they did was good.
Noises
I have to say that the music was blaring out the whole time and so was very annoying. Especially when you go to have a chat. I asked for it to be toned down but this was largely ignored. A lot of people in the place were also upset by it. This spoilt are experience and for a lot of people. I hope the management take notice. It’s ok to have music but the main reason for people going is to chat and talk and have food.
So to recap not disability friendly as such but help was good. Lighting was not an issue when went but certainly the music was.
A positive response about disability would be good and the music.

Great find.
Mar 2019 • friends
We had just been to The Roebuck Inn were we had enjoyed a real ale and a meal and decided to drop into Malt Cross for a quick real ale..
"This is one superb bar,set over a couple of floors with exquisite architectural features including a high ornately decorated ceiling and a cool looking serving bar, beers on offer are displayed on boards behind the bar and there's plenty of seating options spread throughout this bar, it's just one cool place to unwind in."
"My brother and I were here on a Wednesday night,greeted warmly by a very pleasant member of staff who served us a real ale each,I opted to have a dry hopped lager while my brother went for an EPA ,both these real ales were served in excellent condition, we just chilled out and took in the great bar we were in."
"My dry hopped lager was outstandingly tasty, a hoppy, well balanced lager style beer bursting with taste and very easy to drink indeed, a beer style I really enjoyed, my brother also gave the thumbs up to his real ale."
We really enjoyed our real ales in here before we moved on and as on every other visit to here we had a great time.
The Malt Cross is easy to locate on St James Street.
Opening hours are;
"Monday to Friday, Open from 11am."
"Saturday & Sunday, Open from 10am."
"A great bar ,one I highly recommend you visit if your in the area."

Excellent Tour of Caves and Lovely Lunch
Feb 2019 • friends
This is a lovely heritage experience in what used to be an old Victorian music hall in Nottingham City. Underneath the pub/ cafe/ bar are caves and we attended an excellent tour led by a most knowledgeable guide called Phil. We paid a charge of £5 which went to charity and it was excellent value. I really liked the idea that the premises are also used at night by the Street pastors for the homeless in the City.

"The crowning moment of the tour was when in the depths of the caves Phil played an original recording of one of the artists who had appeared in the music hall. The tour began in the music hall area, with many original features that still remain and an amazing glass roof with the original timbers."

We chose to have lunch afterwards in the pub area which is very user friendly and Iwould happily visit on my own as an older lady for a coffee or light lunch and feel very safe.

"The food was delicious, excellent sandwiches very generously filled and served with a lovely coleslaw that had never seen a supermarket tub! The staff were most friendly and knew their beers and spirits. There is a very good selection of real ales according to my husband."

We will most certainly visit again

The balcony area is very nice and the toilets are very clean.

Great sweet potato fries
Feb 2019 • couples
Love the history. Fresh chicken club sandwich and delicious sweet potato fries. It was midweek and quite a few people in for lunch. Could do with a lick of paint.

Real Ale delight
Feb 2019 • couples
The former Victorian Music Hall provides an elaborate example of fabulous architecture and ambience. Excellent ales and just the ticket for atmosphere and socialising in a wonderful CAMRA friendly pub. Another Nottingham jewel.

I’m not cooking tonight!
Feb 2019 • none
"Chilled atmosphere, pleasant surroundings, efficient staff! Both of us had burgers - beef & chicken breast on brioche bun & fries. Chicken was moist and exceptionally tasty. Beef patty apparently very good too. The chips were glorious - sizzling hot and crispy. With a Pinot Grigio spritzer - well, my cup runneth over! Apparently the Navigator ale was excellent too!"

Full of character
Dec 2018 • friends
Great place to visit for a drink or a meal. Used to be a musical venue - features of which are still evident. Offers an interesting range of drinks including mint chocolate chip ale! Seating upstairs and downstairs. Menu is tempting and well worth trying out. Can get rather busy at the weekend lunch times. Has its own unique visiting area displaying caves on which the building is located. Worth a visit.

Called in for a pint and had a coffee.
Dec 2018 • friends
"Called in this great old public house, to experience the ambience of time gone by. I Used to frequent this pub in my college days and was always a great atmosphere. Great pub to visit whilst in Nottingham."

We did not eat on this occasion although the menu was varied. We were both Just a little surprised at the price of most of the draft beers all encroaching £5 a pint !!!
"a little steep in my estimation, so we settled for a coffee whilst reminiscing in these original surroundings."

TIP: go upstairs to enjoy the ambience at its greatest

Disappointing food
Dec 2018 • couples
"Came in for Lunch on a Sunday. The decor and atmosphere is as good as usual, but the food was average at best. I had the mushroom and beef wellington, my partner had the chicken burger. The food was near-cold and disappointing. When I told the waitress, she simply said “oh”."
A real shame as this is one of my favourite spots in Nottingham. I will probably only return to drink here.

Sunday Dinner
Nov 2018 • family
"We were looking for somewhere that did Sunday dinner and dropped in at the Malt Cross they had some great ales to choose from including Deception from the Abbeydale Brewery and we ordered three Pork Roasts at £9.95 each. When it came it was plentiful and tasty and the meat was melt in the mouth and had obviously been slow cooked, there was a Yorkshire pudding smashed potato and roast vegetables on a separate wooden platter comprising of carrot, parsnip, and red cabbage. The gravy was warm and very tasty after been made with the meat juices. If you are looking for a tasty meal in generous portions with good ale and atmospheric comfortable surroundings then I would highly recommend you try The Malt Cross."

Business group reunion
Nov 2018 • friends
10 of our party were beautifully served an evening pub meal. The service is low key and hugely caring.

"Although informal, all food is made with fresh local produce and hand made hamburgers to die for!"

"The atmosphere is unique and strangely hallowed, that when looking around stimulates conversation."

They take their draught beer and ciders seriously.

I love the Malt Cross

Gin tasting
Nov 2018 • couples
"My wife and I went to a gin tasting in the caves beneath The Malt Cross. We tasted 5 different gins ranging across a varied style. Thoroughly enjoyed it, staff were friendly and enthusiastic. I think the gin tasting is quite a new thing but there was a great atmosphere in both the company and the location. I know the Malt Cross from the 80s when it used to be one of my regular haunts, I never realised there was so much history below ground! The pub itself is friendly and relaxed, I've never eaten there but will try it one day. Great place to visit with loads of original features and a well stocked bar. What is there not to like?"

Glad the Bell Inn was closed......
Oct 2018 • couples
"... on a night out showing a friend some of our oldest hostelries in Nottingham and was ending at the Bell Inn, when we got there it was closed, so we made our way to the Malt Cross. My friend was pleasantly surprised with the place, as was I. Lovely atmosphere and surroundings, and after having a fish and chip supper we promised to come back again pretty sharpish. It was on par with Harry Ramsdams if not better, mmmm mmmmm"

Make sure you're hungry!
Oct 2018 • couples
"Visited for Sunday lunch - my husband had roast pork and I had the mushroom & sweet potato wellington (vegan option). Both meals were excellent and each came with a side plate of roasted root vegetables. The portions were huge - too much really, one portion of veggies would have been enough for both of us I think. Staff were friendly, chatty and helpful. Food took about 30 mins to arrive. Only slight niggle was that there was no gravy with the vegan meal so it was a bit dry. Beer and cider as good as ever. Love the atmosphere here - it seems to attract everyone from students to ancients. And it's terrific value for money!"
